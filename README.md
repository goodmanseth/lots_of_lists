## Features
The main features of this application are to be able to add, remove, and edit albums to the database. These features are
only available to users once they've signed in. The navigation bar gives access to the total albums list (/albums), "My Albums"--
which corresponds to the current_user's albums (/myalbums), and "Add New Music"--which allows the user to create new albums
(/albums/new). The user can also delete albums, but only the ones they've added to the database. The user can also add and 
delete comments. The albums can be sorted, using the sort buttons at the top of the page, and they can be searched for, using the
search bar in the navigation bar.
